FSM Entropy Overlay Module: Resilient control for ARCHON hybrid CPUs. This Verilog FSM dynamically adjusts system behavior (stall, flush, lock) using ML predictions, entropy scores, hazard flags, and override signals to enhance stability and security. Fully synthesized and simulated, it's the hazard reflex backbone, ready for FPGA integration.
